#### Python | explaining terms

Here are some terminology used in python 

**1. Dynamically typed:**
  In languges like C/C++, Java we need to explicitly specify the data type of a variable before initializing that to data also we canot switch data types in between like an integer datatype cannot store a string.
  But in python , we do not have that restriction, we can switch the data types anywhere in the program i.e one variable can hold any data type or data structure.
  
 **2. Mutable and Immutable :**
   The data structures whose values can be altered after creation are known as mutable e.g lists , dictionaries, sets
   The ones which once created , data values cannot be added to it. e.g strings , tuples
   
**3. Ordered and unordered :**
   Ordered data types are the ones whose data can accessed by means of indexing as their elements are placed in a       sequence (e.g lists, strings, tuples) whereas unordered data structures have randomly placed elements (sets) and cannot be accessed by indexing.
   
**4. Iterable -**
  All those kind of objects that allow being looped over are known as iterables
